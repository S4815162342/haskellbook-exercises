# haskellbook-exercises

This repository contains my solutions and exploratory notes from working through  
*Haskell Programming from First Principles*.

All notebooks reflect an ongoing, hands-on learning process.

## About

This repository serves as:
- a **record of systematic practice** in functional programming with Haskell
- a **learning log**, organized roughly by chapter
- a place to experiment with ideas, types, and abstractions from the book

---

## Structure

Each folder corresponds (approximately) to a chapter in the book and contains
notes and exercise solutions, mostly in the form of Jupyter notebooks (IHaskell).

Not all chapters are complete, and some solutions may be partial or revised over time.

---

## Notes

- The repository is intentionally uneven in places.
- Some notebooks are drafts or work in progress.
- I update and clean material incrementally as I revisit topics.
