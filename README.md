My solutions to exercises from **Haskell programming from first principles**. 
# Haskell Portfolio 

Welcome to my **Haskell Portfolio**, where I showcase my journey through functional programming and problem-solving using Haskell! üöÄ

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from the book Haskell Programming from First Principles (a.k.a. the Haskell Book). My goal is to create a collection of well-organized and reusable Haskell notebooks.

## üîç About This Repository

This portfolio serves as:
- A **showcase** of my skills in Haskell and functional programming.
- A **learning journal** documenting my progress as I work through the exercises in the Haskell Book.
- A **toolkit** for potential collaborators, employers, or fellow learners to see my problem-solving approach.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Organized Solutions**: All exercises are solved, reviewed, and categorized by chapter.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebooks**: Solutions are presented as notebooks to allow easy exploration and execution of the code.
- **Incremental Progress**: I periodically update the repository with improved solutions and additional content.

---

Each folder corresponds to a chapter in the Haskell Book, and each file contains solutions to the exercises from that chapter.
